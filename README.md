# MouseJiggler
A quick-and-dirty mouse jiggler program, using Java's Robot library

Much like the rest of my personal projects created before I started using github, the master branch is the original code as found in my files.
If I see any improvements to be made, a develop branch is made, off of which feat/ branches are made to produce new features and changes.
